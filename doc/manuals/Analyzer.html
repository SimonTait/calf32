            <h2>Functionality</h2>
            <p>
                An Analyzer inspects the audio signal and displays various graphs to
                give an impression of the structure of a sound. It is able to draw a
                frequency response graph with adjustable accuracy and some other features
                as well as a phase correlation meter (goniometer). The frequency response shows
                how much energy a signal has over the frequency range. The goniometer gives
                a great impression of the stereo behavior of your track.
            </p>
            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>goniometer</strong> shows mono and stereo allocation of your audio
                signal. A signal mostly vertical around the center shows a high mono ratio while
                a signal with a wide spread from left to right displays a signal with a high
                amount of stereo (phase shift) signal. A signal only audible on the right
                speaker will produce a line from south west to north east and vice versa.
            </p>
            <h2>Controls</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Source:</strong> Select the source for the frequency response graph.</li>
                <li><strong>Mode:</strong> Set a mode for the behavior of the frequency response graph.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> The amount of visible frequencies. It also raises the delay of the displayed signal.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> How often a FFT is calculated and displayed.</li>
                <li><strong>Hold:</strong> Draw a maximum peak graph above the output graph.</li>
                <li><strong>Freeze:</strong> Freeze the graph in the actual state. An eventually displayed peak hold will continue in being pushed to the limit.</li>
                <li><strong>Display:</strong> Stop displaying this widget.</li>
                <li><strong>Level:</strong> Raise the level of the displayed signal.</li>
                <li><strong>Dots:</strong> The amount of dots shown on the canvas.</li>
                <li><strong>Fade:</strong> Choose if a fade out effect should be drawn (doesn't raise the overall CPU consumption) and how fast it should disappear.</li>
            </ul>
